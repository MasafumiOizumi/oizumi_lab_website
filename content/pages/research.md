overview: >-
  Our laboratory aims to elucidate the mechanisms of subjective experience
  through mathematical theories. We broadly categorize the problems of
  consciousness into three pillars: 1) the **quality** of consciousness, 2) the
  **levels** of consciousness, and 3) the **location** of consciousness. We
  address fundamental questions such as: What determines the qualitative
  difference between visual and auditory experiences? Why does consciousness
  fade during deep sleep? Our primary working hypothesis is Integrated
  Information Theory (IIT), which posits that the essence of consciousness lies
  in "intrinsic information". While we utilize the framework of IIT as a
  starting point, our primary focus is to overcome the theoretical and
  computational limitations that currently hinder the scientific testing of such
  mathematical theories.\

  \

  To establish a rigorous basis for experimental verification, we tackle two critical hurdles. The first is the empirical challenge: How can we quantify subjective experiences as mathematical objects in psychophysical experiments? To address this, we propose a structural approach that characterizes the relational geometry of subjective experience, which we term "qualia structures." The second is the mathematical and computational challenge: How should we practically estimate theoretical quantities (e.g., integrated information) in large-scale neural systems? To handle this complexity, we employ tools from information geometry, dynamical systems theory, network control theory, and stochastic thermodynamics. These methods allow us to characterize causal relationships in the brain and develop practical algorithms for computing information-theoretic measures that were previously infeasible.\

  \

  By combining these mathematical methodologies with experimental collaborations, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and data. For example, we analyze neural activity during sleep and anesthesia to verify if theoretical measures correctly track changes in consciousness levels, and we investigate whether the mathematical structure of subjective experiences correlates with psychophysical data. Ultimately, our goal is to build an empirical foundation for testing not only IIT but other consciousness theories in general. By facilitating fair comparisons among competing hypotheses, we aim to advance beyond current theoretical limitations and bridge the gap between subjective experience and neural activity.


  Below, we introduce specific research projects addressing these topics.
